## Task 2 - Find Factorial of a Number
Your code should be able to:
* Display in the I/O window the prompt “Enter a number to find factorial: “
* Take a number from the I/O window
* Calculate the factorial of the number
* Display the result to the I/O window
You can use the procedure below to find the factorial of a number.

## Task 3 - Print a Diamond Shape to I/O Window
Write a MIPS program to
* take an integer input from I/O window
* display in the I/O window a diamond whose side containing the number of stars (*) specified by users.
### Example:
Input: 5

Output:

# Project 2
You are supposed to write a MIPS program to check validity of a user-inputted numerical
expression via MIPS simulator I/O window. The syntax for the expression should be based on
Matlab rules. Your program should display the prompt “>>>” for entering an expression of up to
64 symbols. Expressions should include only parentheses (), digits from 0 to 9, and operators +,
-, *, / and spaces. If there is error in an expression, display “Invalid input” in the I/O window; if
there is no error, display “Valid input” in the I/O window.
Your program should loop so that users can enter new expressions without re-assembling the
program. Your code should be commented.
